# GifTastic

In this assignment, we were required to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of our choice.


Instructions:

Enter a year into the search box. As you enter terms into the search box, buttons will appear above with the term entered and gifs related to that term will appear . 
The theme is Harry Potter to inspire you to enter a Harry Potter term, but feel free to search any items that is of interest to you.
